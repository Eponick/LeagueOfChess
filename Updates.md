# Updates

Got an animated sprite system coded up today. Im taking the time to write everything neatly since others may be helping me later.
Unfortunately progress will be semi-slow on the weekdays (Curse you Work/League of Legends!)

I also made the GitHub repository for this project today. Thanks for the idea Swooper86!
I plan to spend a little time on the GitHub wiki tomorrow to update some project goals and milestones.
