# LeagueOfChess

## Basic Description
An online multiplayer revision of the classic game of Chess, with a League of Legends fan inspired twist. 

## The Idea
The idea came from a thread posted to the League of Legends reddit on 12/27/2015 by user Zaaptastic. It was ment to be a sort of parody of Riot's balancing/patch notes, but several users thought it sounded fun (myself included) so here we are.

## Who am I?
I am just a simple fan of League of Legends who also likes to make games for fun and hobby. I go by Eponick most places.

## Need any help?
YES! I would totally love to make this a community thing! I could really use a decent pixel artist who can make some sprites/backgrounds with League themes (Minion pawns, champion pieces, etc.).
As of now I am still making spaghetti so I am not sure about programmers yet. When I do then C++ knowledge is a must, and familiarity with Raknet/networking is a plus.
