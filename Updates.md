There has been progress made. I have created the dedicated server command line application and have implemented the networking to the client and server. Soon there will be actual progress on the game play.

Got an animated sprite system coded up today. Im taking the time to write everything neatly since others may be helping me later.
Unfortunately progress will be semi-slow on the weekdays (Curse you Work/League of Legends!)

I also made the GitHub repository for this project today. Thanks for the idea Swooper86!
I plan to spend a little time on the GitHub wiki tomorrow to update some project goals and milestones.
